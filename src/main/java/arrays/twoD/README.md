**Robot Grid**: We have an m x n grid. A robot is placed at the top-left corner of this grid. The robot can only move either right or down at any point in time, but it is not allowed to move in certain cells. The robot's goal is to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

**Robot Grid all paths**: We have an mxn grid. Get all possible paths from top-left position to bottom-right position in grid

**Biggest Color Spot**: Consider an r x c grid where r stands for rows and c stands for columns. Each cell has a color represented by a number k (for example, for three colors, k=3). We define the connected set of a cell (or a color spot) as the total cells in which we can go from the respective cell by successive displacements on the row or the column, thus keeping the color. The goal is to determine the color and the number of cells of the maximum connected set. In other words, we need to determine the biggest color spot.

**N Cents**: Consider an amount of n cents. Count the ways you can change this amount using any number of quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents), and pennies (1 cent).

**Five Towers**:  Consider a 5x5 grid with five defensive towers spread across the grid. To provide an optimal defense for the grid, we have to build a tower on each row of the grid. Find all the solutions for building these towers so that none of them share the same column and diagonal.
